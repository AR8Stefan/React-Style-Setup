## Adding a CSS Modules Stylesheet

> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@2.0.0` and higher.

This project supports [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) alongside regular stylesheets using the `[name].module.css` file naming convention. CSS Modules allows the scoping of CSS by automatically creating a unique classname of the format `[filename]\_[classname]\_\_[hash]`.

> **Tip:** Should you want to preprocess a stylesheet with Sass then make sure to [follow the installation instructions](#adding-a-sass-stylesheet) and then change the stylesheet file extension as follows: `[name].module.scss` or `[name].module.sass`.

CSS Modules let you use the same CSS class name in different files without worrying about naming clashes. Learn more about CSS Modules [here](https://css-tricks.com/css-modules-part-1-need/).

### `Button.module.css`

```css
.error {
  background-color: red;
}
```

### `another-stylesheet.css`

```css
.error {
  color: red;
}
```

### `Button.js`

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import styles from './Button.module.css'; // Import css modules stylesheet as styles
import './another-stylesheet.css'; // Import regular stylesheet

class Button extends Component {
  render() {
    // reference as a js object
    return <button className={styles.error}>Error Button</button>;
  }
}
```

### Result

No clashes from other `.error` class names

```html
<!-- This button has red background but not red text -->
<button class="Button_error_ax7yz"></div>
```

**This is an optional feature.** Regular `<link>` stylesheets and CSS files are fully supported. CSS Modules are turned on for files ending with the `.module.css` extension.

## Adding a Sass Stylesheet

> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@2.0.0` and higher.

Generally, we recommend that you don’t reuse the same CSS classes across different components. For example, instead of using a `.Button` CSS class in `<AcceptButton>` and `<RejectButton>` components, we recommend creating a `<Button>` component with its own `.Button` styles, that both `<AcceptButton>` and `<RejectButton>` can render (but [not inherit](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)).

Following this rule often makes CSS preprocessors less useful, as features like mixins and nesting are replaced by component composition. You can, however, integrate a CSS preprocessor if you find it valuable.

To use Sass, first install `node-sass`:

```bash
$ npm install node-sass --save
$ # or
$ yarn add node-sass
```

Now you can rename `src/App.css` to `src/App.scss` and update `src/App.js` to import `src/App.scss`.
This file and any other file will be automatically compiled if imported with the extension `.scss` or `.sass`.

To share variables between Sass files, you can use Sass imports. For example, `src/App.scss` and other component style files could include `@import "./shared.scss";` with variable definitions.

This will allow you to do imports like

```scss
@import 'styles/_colors.scss'; // assuming a styles directory under src/
@import '~nprogress/nprogress'; // importing a css file from the nprogress node module
```

> **Tip:** You can opt into using this feature with [CSS modules](#adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet) too!

> **Note:** You must prefix imports from `node_modules` with `~` as displayed above.

> **Note:** If you're using Flow, add the following to your `.flowconfig` so it'll recognize the `.sass` or `.scss` imports.

```
[options]
module.file_ext=.sass
module.file_ext=.scss
```

## Post-Processing CSS

This project setup minifies your CSS and adds vendor prefixes to it automatically through [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) so you don’t need to worry about it.

Support for new CSS features like the [`all` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/all), [`break` properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-3/#breaking-controls), [custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables), and [media query ranges](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#range-context) are automatically polyfilled to add support for older browsers.

You can customize your target support browsers by adjusting the `browserslist` key in `package.json` according to the [Browserslist specification](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#readme).

For example, this:

```css
.App {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  align-items: center;
}
```

becomes this:

```css
.App {
  display: -webkit-box;
  display: -ms-flexbox;
  display: flex;
  -webkit-box-orient: horizontal;
  -webkit-box-direction: normal;
  -ms-flex-direction: row;
  flex-direction: row;
  -webkit-box-align: center;
  -ms-flex-align: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

If you need to disable autoprefixing for some reason, [follow this section](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer#disabling).

[CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) prefixing is disabled by default, but it will **not** strip manual prefixing.
If you'd like to opt-in to CSS Grid prefixing, [first familiarize yourself about its limitations](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer#does-autoprefixer-polyfill-grid-layout-for-ie).<br>
To enable CSS Grid prefixing, add `/* autoprefixer grid: on */` to the top of your CSS file.

## Adding Images, Fonts, and Files

With Webpack, using static assets like images and fonts works similarly to CSS.

You can **`import` a file right in a JavaScript module**. This tells Webpack to include that file in the bundle. Unlike CSS imports, importing a file gives you a string value. This value is the final path you can reference in your code, e.g. as the `src` attribute of an image or the `href` of a link to a PDF.

To reduce the number of requests to the server, importing images that are less than 10,000 bytes returns a [data URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) instead of a path. This applies to the following file extensions: bmp, gif, jpg, jpeg, and png. SVG files are excluded due to [#1153](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/1153).

Here is an example:

```js
import React from 'react';
import logo from './logo.png'; // Tell Webpack this JS file uses this image

console.log(logo); // /logo.84287d09.png

function Header() {
  // Import result is the URL of your image
  return <img src={logo} alt="Logo" />;
}

export default Header;
```

This ensures that when the project is built, Webpack will correctly move the images into the build folder, and provide us with correct paths.

This works in CSS too:

```css
.Logo {
  background-image: url(./logo.png);
}
```

Webpack finds all relative module references in CSS (they start with `./`) and replaces them with the final paths from the compiled bundle. If you make a typo or accidentally delete an important file, you will see a compilation error, just like when you import a non-existent JavaScript module. The final filenames in the compiled bundle are generated by Webpack from content hashes. If the file content changes in the future, Webpack will give it a different name in production so you don’t need to worry about long-term caching of assets.

Please be advised that this is also a custom feature of Webpack.

**It is not required for React** but many people enjoy it (and React Native uses a similar mechanism for images).<br>
An alternative way of handling static assets is described in the next section.

### Adding SVGs

> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@2.0.0` and higher.

One way to add SVG files was described in the section above. You can also import SVGs directly as React components. You can use either of the two approaches. In your code it would look like this:

```js
import { ReactComponent as Logo } from './logo.svg';
const App = () => (
  <div>
    {/* Logo is an actual React component */}
    <Logo />
  </div>
);
```

This is handy if you don't want to load SVG as a separate file. Don't forget the curly braces in the import! The `ReactComponent` import name is special and tells Create React App that you want a React component that renders an SVG, rather than its filename.

## Using React-Bootstrap
(source = https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction/)

### Installing.
```
$npm install --save react react-dom
$npm install --save react-bootstrap
```

### ES6
ES6 modules aren't supported natively yet, but you can use the syntax now with the help of a transpiler like Babel.

```
import Button from 'react-bootstrap/lib/Button';
// or
import { Button } from 'react-bootstrap';
```
